# - The workspace is "zephyr-workspace"
# - Under it, there is the folder "zephyr", and it is the main Zephyr RTOS repository, which is the RTOS that our application runs on top of.
# - This "west.yml" file is a blueprint that will "update" the Zephyr RTOS to the corresponding version and download necessary modules
# - When we run "west update -n". The folder ".west" under the workspace will be searched for "config", which will then link to this "west.yml"
